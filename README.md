# MvTAe-Multivariate-Temporal-Autoencoder
This code demonstrates a multi-branch deep neural network approach to tackling the problem of multivariate temporal sequence prediction by modelling a latent state vector representation of data windows through the use of a recurrent autoencoder and predictive model.
